TestNG Listener and Screenshot Capture Demo
This project demonstrates how to use TestNG Listeners to capture screenshots for failed tests in an automated test suite using Selenium WebDriver. The main objective is to show how to extend the functionality of TestNG with listeners to automate common post-test actions, like capturing screenshots when a test fails.


.

📜 Project Overview
This project showcases the following:

TestNG Listeners: Capture different events (like test start, success, failure) during test execution.

Screenshot on Failure: Automatically capture and save a screenshot when a test fails.

Selenium WebDriver: Use of Selenium WebDriver to perform basic browser automation (using ChromeDriver).

Maven Project: A simple Maven project setup for easy management of dependencies.


Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. 
git clone https://github.com/muhammadirfan1236/testng-screenshot-on-failure.git


.

📝 Key Features
TestNG Listener: Listens for test events (start, success, failure, skip) and triggers actions accordingly.

Screenshot Capture on Failure: Automatically saves a screenshot of the browser window when a test fails.

Maven Integration: Easy-to-manage dependencies using Maven for Selenium and TestNG.

Custom Reporting: The project prints logs to the console indicating whether tests passed or failed and saves screenshots for failures.
